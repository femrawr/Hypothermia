# Hypothermia
An advance remote access tool fully controllable by a Discord bot.

## Building
> ⚠️ **Notice:** This is not intended for the average user. Basic scripting knowledge is required.

- Install [golang](https://go.dev/doc/install).
- In the `scripts` folder, change the paths to match your environment.
- In the `config/constants.go` file, replace `BotToken`, `ServerId` and `CategoryId` to your own Discord bot token, server ID, and category ID.
- Those values **MUST** be encrypted. Use `scripts/encrypt.bat` to encrypt them.
- After you have done that, run `scripts/build.bat` and an executable will appear in the `build` folder.
